## **Joe Martin**           

### MS in Business Analytics Student

#### **About Me**  
<img src="swp_martin_0001 - Copy (2).png" alt="Joe Martin" style="float:left;padding-right:10px;"> I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2016. Having studied Philosophy and Journalism, my interests were aligned in media and publishing. Following graduation, I joined a start-up that uses natural language processing to review fiction manuscripts at scale. 

I'm currently the Assistant Director of Admissions Operations for Georgia's Full-Time MBA program. I work behind the scenes managing our application system and CRM, building digital resources for our students, and sometimes emerge from my office to help recruit new students. 

In addition to my full-time role in Terry, I'm also pursuing my MS in Business Analytics. I'm primarily interested in process management and mining for data to understand how end-users actually engage with online content. 

I've been working in R for a couple of years now, primarily analyzing data related to our applicants and our office's workflow. Additionally,
I've completed coursework in SQL and Python. Other than the couple of courses I've completed so far, most of my knowledge in programming and data analysis has been self-taught, so I hope to use this course to better learn principles for data analysis and programming to make me a more efficient data scientist. 

#### **Running**
I've now completed two marathons and I'm running my third in November 2021. I began distance running in 2012 when I was starting college and and almost always recorded my workouts on my phone or my Garmin watch. As such, I have years-worth of data that I've been working to clean and analyze in R. Data for the last few years lives on my github (<a href="https://github.com/jmar0904" target="_blank">@jmar0904</a>), but I'm glad to share further back if anyone can help me clean it :-)

#### **The Cartoon Guide to Statistics**
I began my MSBA program after about 4 years of full-time work. Although I'm in a highly-quantitative program that includes a lot of statistical work, I've found that I'm a bit rusty in my knowledge of stats and need refreshing. I found this wonderful book called <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheCartoonGuideToStatistics/mode/2up" target="_blank">The Cartoon Guide to Statistics</a>, which has been much easier to digest than any other stats textbooks I've read.
