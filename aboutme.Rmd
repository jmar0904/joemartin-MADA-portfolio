## **Joe Martin**           

### MS in Business Analytics Student

#### **About Me**  
<img src="swp_martin_0001 - Copy (2).png" alt="Joe Martin" style="float:left;padding-right:10px;"> I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2016. Having studied Philosophy and Journalism, my interests were aligned in media and publishing. Following graduation, I joined a start-up that uses natural language processing to review fiction manuscripts at scale. Throughout my time here, I was mainly in charge of developing content for our website and social media, conducting customer research, and making sales. However, I became more interested in the technical side of the company. 

I moved to Athens in 2018 and I'm currently the Assistant Director of Admissions Operations for Georgia's Full-Time MBA program. I work behind the scenes managing our CRM/applicant database and building digital resources for our students. I occasionally emerge from my office to help recruit new students. 

In addition to my full-time role in Terry, I'm also pursuing my MS in Business Analytics. I'm primarily interested in process management and mining for data to understand how end-users engage with online content. 

I've been working in R for a couple of years now, primarily analyzing data related to our applicants and our office's workflow. Additionally, I've completed coursework in SQL and Python. Other than the couple of courses I've completed so far, most of my knowledge in programming and data analysis has been self-taught, so I hope to use this course to become a more

 better learn principles for data analysis and programming to make me a more efficient data scientist. 

#### **Running**
I’m currently training for my third marathon, as well as the <a href="https://athhalf.com/">AthHalf</a>. I began distance running in 2012 when I was starting college and almost always recorded my workouts on my phone or my Garmin watch. As such, I have years-worth of data that I've been working to clean and analyze in R. Data for the last few years lives on my github (<a href="https://github.com/jmar0904" target="_blank">@jmar0904</a>), but I'm glad to share further back if anyone can help me clean it :-)

#### **The Cartoon Guide to Statistics**
Returning to school after being in the workforce, it’s now been about 7 years since my last stats course. Although I’m comfortable with quantitative work and I’m in a quantitative program, I’ve found that my stats knowledge is a bit rusty. I found this wonderful book called <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheCartoonGuideToStatistics/mode/2up" target="_blank">The Cartoon Guide to Statistics</a>, which has been much easier to digest than any other stats textbooks I've read.
